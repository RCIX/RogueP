TODO

next:

*make a simple enemy program that can use memory and has random walk behavior
 *define hostile programs with behavior types, stats, executable libraries, etc. and a single hostileprogram flag

short term:

*properly offset world frame/action overlay frame from top left
 *not really needed until pseudoterminal and info pane added
*make a single/simple library (in game concept) and build UI code for display
 *create a library/inventory frame
 *create a command details pane
 *hard code a single library for now
 *most, if not all, libraries will require additional world elements to interact with, so this may have to wait for a good deal of time

medium term:

*either write single info pane UI frame or different kinds of command pane that render over the rest of the UI
*explore options for world generation (how? what kind of world do I want to generate? will there be levels or is it continuous? etc.)
*start storing player and world attributes (enemy program stats, library stats, etc.) in configuration files instead of hardcoded (requires finding a data format - probably JSON)
*

long term:


*create xp sheets for color palettes, display characters, etc.
*start saving 
*finish drafting title screen and display on main menu
*begin thinking of distinct program types and mechanics beyond "shoot thing, it dies"
*explore options for animation(whether procedural or preloaded from .xp)


Completed thus far (started 9/9):

*Convert action history saving into distinct codepath
*expand terminal to display responses as well (scrape UI events to show what's happening)
