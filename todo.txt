TODO

*make a simple enemy program that can use memory and has random walk behavior
*start pulling character data out into .xp sheets for customizability
*clean up and improve input handling code
*make a single/simple library (in game concept) and build UI code for display
 *create a library/inventory frame
 *hard code a single library for now
 *most, if not all, libraries will require additional world elements to interact with, so this may have to wait for a good deal of time
*properly offset world frame/action overlay frame from top left
*decide what model of world grid to use (rooms? blank space? what)
*make options menu
*finish drafting title screen and display on main menu
*explore options for animation(whether procedural or preloaded from .xp)
